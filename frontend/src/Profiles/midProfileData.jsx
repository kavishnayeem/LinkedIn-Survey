  "about": "Hi, my name is Ashley Merritt, and I recently graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor's degree in Management. I’m passionate about social media, marketing, management, and real estate, and I aim to help businesses effectively promote their goods and services through innovative marketing strategies. I completed a seven-month internship at Mechanical One as a marketing intern, where I learned how to use Photoshop and WordPress, conducted market research, managed social media accounts, created marketing materials, and assisted on set for filming commercials. Additionally, I have worked as a lifeguard and swim coach at my local country club, which has helped me develop essential skills in communication, leadership, and responsibility. I’m proficient in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator, and I have a basic working knowledge of Spanish. Now that I have graduated, I’m eager to find a fulfilling job and eventually pursue a Master’s degree.",
